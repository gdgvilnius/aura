    "aboutGDGProgram":"GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons. GDG Vilnius is an independent group; our activities and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google, the corporation.
